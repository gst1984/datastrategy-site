    <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>I moved from Salzburg to Vienna in 2003 to study software engineering at <strong>TU Wien</strong>, and somehow never left. My first real job threw me into business intelligence consulting at <strong>Harrer & Partner</strong> — crunching data for universities, car companies, anyone who'd have me. But it was a project in the cultural sector that changed everything. Turns out, helping a theater understand its audience was more interesting to me than optimizing supply chains.</p>
        <p>That thread kept pulling. I went self-employed in 2013, dove deeper into analytics for arts organizations through <strong><a href="https://kulturplanner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kulturplanner</a></strong> — eventually becoming CTO before moving to the advisory board. In 2014, I co-founded what would become <strong><a href="https://easy-connect.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy-connect</a></strong> — a mobile platform for arts and culture organizations that somehow kept growing.</p>
        <p>Along the way, I spent a few years as CTO at <strong><a href="https://idagio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDAGIO</a></strong>, the classical music streaming platform, and started <strong>Data Strategy Services</strong> for independent consulting work.</p>
        <p>The common thread? I keep ending up at the intersection of technology and culture. It wasn't planned — it just turned out to be where I'm most useful and most happy.</p>

            <p>I love anything strategic — from engine builders to heavy euros. Stefan and I once made it to runner-up at the Pandemic World Championship, which remains one of our proudest and nerdiest moments.</p>

            <p>I'm happiest when I'm somewhere unfamiliar. Highlights include a road trip around Iceland, tracking mountain gorillas in the wild in Rwanda, and wandering through ancient Persepolis on a trip across Iran.</p>

            <p>I grew up in Salzburg, so skiing and mountains are basically in my DNA. Vienna is wonderful — but I still need my alpine fix.</p>
