This is a sample draft post. When you're ready to publish, move it from `_drafts/` to `_posts/` and rename it with a date prefix:

```
_posts/2026-02-15-hello-world.md
```

## Writing workflow

1. Write in **Obsidian** as a regular Markdown file
2. Add the front matter (title, description) at the top
3. Copy to `_posts/` with the date prefix
4. Push to GitHub — Jekyll builds it automatically

That's it. No build tools, no CLI, just Markdown and git.
